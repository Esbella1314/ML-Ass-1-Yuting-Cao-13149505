        "However, the orders of the content are a bit messy, it didn’t follow up a clear structure when give the formulas and state the content, quite hard for me to put everything together easily and understand things well. Also the formulas are too many and been explained the same thing again and again. I guess the author wants to make sure the readers can understand his article well that’s why he always tries to explain the same things couple times, but this makes the article very massive and even make me feel confused and worried about missing any information he is giving, but actually there are just many things are being told over again and again which wastes time. \n",
        "What’s more, there are many things haven’t been explained such as what’s NP-Complete, NP-Hard problems and etc., so I have to do a lot of extra researches to help me understand the article, even if the author has put some references to show me that I could refer to some other resources, but it takes a bit longer time for me to combine the knowledge I learn from other articles with this one and understand the article.\n",
        "As a whole, this paper has come up a solution for a very famous NP-Complete problem through Bayesian network which is great but maybe organize the content better and give more explanations in the article will be more helpful for readers to understand the article."

Since there is no any general or exact algorithm can fit all the problems, so we face different problems especially the complicated problems, we need to analyze the problem, to approach a more accurate result, we should find the most suitable algorithms for the corresponding problems. \n",

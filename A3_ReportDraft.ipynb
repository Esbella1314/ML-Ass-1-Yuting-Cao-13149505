        "As people all know that Chinese students are very diligent, many of us have learnt English for many years, our English foundation is very steadily, however, most of us are just good at reading and writing, the English practical application ability is very poor, when we need to speak or listening, we are weaker than many other countries’ students. \n",
        "China has open herself to the whole world for many years and China is still developing very fast. English is the number one worldwide language, if we can acknowledge English, then it means we have the key to know the world. Our Chinese students should improve the English practical application ability, can understand what other people are saying and expressing our thoughts clearly as well. We should communicate with the world, go to a bigger world, to be international.\n",
        "Quality-oriented education is the trend of future education, I used to operate this program in Wuhan, China from 2012 to 2014 which is to open an English training center to train people’s English listening and speaking ability. This is a very good program with great future which is aiming to help people who want to improve their English communicate ability. I was very optimistic about this program, I thought that many people will love my ideas and come to study in my training center, before I did marketing investment, I did not do any data analysis but just invest a lot money in marketing with my subjective judgment, and the result is that I lost a big amount of money in marketing investment with very low revenue.\n",
        "At the same time, I find out that even though the Oral-English training marketing still have get a hug part to share, but since most of the students are not interested in Oral-English, they think that it’s useless, what they want is to have CET-4 and CET-6 trainings to pass those English exams, so find the target people and make an efficient marketing investment is very necessary instead of spending money in each place to try good luck. \n",
        "Because of those fail reasons, now I need to do data analysis and project planning ahead to improve the successful rate of the project."

        "The exam-oriented education makes us forget what’s the real meaning of studying, studying should be because we want to study, we love that domain but not just for passing the exams. There are some people who want to learn English really well, or want to study abroad, or want to work in the foreign companies, all of them want to have a good and real communication with the world, but because of poor English communication ability, it has limit their chances to go further.\n",
        "This project will only be executed in Wuhan, China, so all the data I collect in this paper are based in the Wuhan marketing. In Wuhan, the Oral-English training is still very new, there is a big potential marketing in this domain. There are only a few training centers who provide Oral-English trainings such as New Oriental and Meten English. So, the marketing competition isn’t that intense yet, with the Oral-English training demanding is increasing, seizing the market opportunity is very important.\n",
